# How to use:
## controls:
```W A S D E Q``` to move and ```MOUSE``` to look around
## settings:
### to edit simulation settings, you need to edit ```simulationsettings.py```

use ODE settings to model real satellites

use PHYS settings to mess around

## Visualization
program will not only show the screen with orbit, but it will save image displaying energies of a satellite in different time points in the main directory of the program as ```energy.png```
